In this project, I created a very basic counter app with an increment and decrement button. It is my first application in React JS in which I practiced that how to :
- Initialize the project using **[create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)**.
- Create components and work with **[bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)**.
- Add dynamic styling.
- Render lists.
- Perform **conditional rendering**.
- Perform **event handling**.
- Pass Event Arguments.
- Compose components and pass data to them.
- Raise the events.
- Update the state.
- Lift the state up.
- Use **functional state components**.
- Use **destructuring**.
- Use **Lifecycle hooks**.
  - **Mount**
    - constructor
    - render
    - componentDidMount
  - **Update**
    - render
    - componentDidUpdate
  - **Unmount**
    - componentWillUnmount
- Perform extreme code refactoring to write an optimized and re-useable code.
 
I used these concepts to implement an end-to-end **[movie management application](https://github.com/Ubaid45/ReactJS_movie-management)** which is deployed **[here](https://desolate-headland-28492.herokuapp.com/movies)**.
